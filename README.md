('nat' in hex)

weird computer girlthing. main git account at git.natalieee.net.

recently it decided it should revive its github account. having an account on a git instance people use tends to be useful.

"skills": 
- very good at making the python interpreter segfault.
- proficcient-in vaguely decreasing amounts-with python, js, lua, a few lisps, and sort of haskell
- shell scripting
- accruing unreasonable computer issues
